# ðŸŽ® Tic-Tac-Toe AI Agent

This is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human player can challenge an unbeatable AI opponent. The AI utilizes the **Minimax algorithm** to determine its optimal moves, ensuring it will never lose a game (it will either win or draw).

## âœ¨ Features

* **Human vs. AI Gameplay:** Play against a smart AI.

* **Unbeatable AI:** The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to play optimally, meaning it will always make the best possible move to win or force a draw.

* **Command-Line Interface:** Simple text-based interaction for easy setup and play.

* **Clear Board Display:** A visual representation of the 3x3 game board.

* **Turn-Based:** Players take turns making moves.

## ðŸ§  How the AI Works (Minimax Algorithm)

The core of this AI lies in the **Minimax algorithm**. Here's a simplified explanation:

1.  **Exploration:** The AI looks ahead at all possible future moves from the current game state.

2.  **Simulation:** For each possible move, it simulates the opponent's best response, and then its own best response to that, and so on, until the game ends (win, loss, or draw).

3.  **Scoring:**

    * If the AI finds a path to a win, it assigns a positive score (+1).

    * If it finds a path where the human wins, it assigns a negative score (-1).

    * A draw results in a score of 0.

4.  **Decision:**

    * The AI (the "maximizing" player) chooses the move that leads to the highest possible score for itself.

    * The human (the "minimizing" player) is assumed to choose the move that leads to the lowest possible score for the AI.

5.  **Optimal Play:** By recursively applying this evaluation to all possible game outcomes, the AI can always select a move that guarantees it the best possible result, preventing any losses.
